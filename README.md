# Character Recognition With MLP from Scratch
This project implements a character recognition system using a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch. The MLP model is trained to recognize uppercase characters ranging from 'A' to 'H' based on a set of predefined binary inputs representing each character. The input to the model consists of a series of binary values representing a grid pattern of each character from 'A' to 'H'. Each character is associated with a corresponding desired output vector, which is a one-hot encoding of the character's identity (i.e., for 'A', the output will be [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]). The model is trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and updates weights using a simple gradient descent algorithm. The goal of the training is to minimize the MSE between the predicted output and the desired output for each input character.
